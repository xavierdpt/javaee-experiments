== Java EE #1 : Servlet lifecycle and logging ==

Hi there, in this video, we investigate the servlet lifecycle and logging.

We first transform the POM+EAR+WAR project from the previous video, just to show how it's done.

Then we introduce the log function, which can be use to log messages and exceptions, and we use it to investigate the servlet lifecycle.


=== POM+EAR+WAR => WAR ===

*Some theory*

Web projects must be packaged into a Web Archive (WAR). This web archive can be deployed on its own, or packaged alongside other components into an Enterprise Archive (EAR).

In the previous video, we've shown how to specify the packaging of a WAR into an EAR with Maven.

In this video, we show the more common single WAR packaging, which is more familiar to most viewers.

This way, viewers will feel more comfortable while still knowing how to move back and forth between different ways of structuring their projects.

*Some practice*

We transform the project from the previous video into a simple WAR project.

. Remove the EAR module.
. Move the content of the `java` folder of the WAR module into the POM module.
. Remove the WAR module.
. Change the pom.xml to a war packaging.
. Update the artifactId.
. Move the dependencies out of the `dependencyManagement` element.
. Remove the project from Eclipse without deleting the content.
. Change the project folder name.
. Import the project again.
. Deploy the project to GlassFish
. Check that it still works.

== log function ==

*Some theory*

The Servlet specification defines a `log` function that can be used to log information into the server's log files.

It can be used to log simple text messages and exceptions.

*Some practice*

Let's use the log function in the `doGet` method, and observe that:

* we can see the output in the console

* we can also see the output in the administration console

Now, let's log an exception just to see the effect.

=== Servlet are singletons ===

*Some theory*

Servlets follow the singleton pattern and can be accessed by multiple threads at the same time. This means that servlets are subject to thread safety problems.

*Some practice*

To show this, we introduce a request counter, which is incremented on each requests.

We also include the servlet's identity and the current thread name in the output log.

This way, we can see that:

* the request counter is incremented for each request
* the object identity is always the same
* the thread which serves the request change every time

=== Initialization : init() and init(ServletConfig) ===

*Some theory*

Servlet initialization code can be placed in the `init()` and `init(ServletConfig)` functions.

*Some practice*

Let's simply add a log statement in each functions and see what happens.

We observe that the `init()` and the `init(ServletConfig)` are called in that order on the first request.

=== Early initialization ===

*Some theory*

The `WebServlet` annotation has a `loadOnStartup` attribute which can be used to load servlets on server startup.

*Some practice*

Let's add this attribute.

We observe that the servlet is initialized during project deployment.

=== destroy method ===

*Some theory*

Servlet cleanup code can be placed in the `destroy()` method.

It is called on server shutdown, when undeploying, and when republishing.

*Some practice*

Let's add a log statement in `destroy()` and observe the effect.

=== Exceptions ===

*Some theory*

Exception handling in servlets is surprisingly complicated.

Three kinds of exceptions (temporary unavailability, permanent unavailability, other) can occur at two places in servlets (initialization, request handling).

The `destroy()` method is only called for permanent unavailability during request handling.

The response codes for temporary unavailability, permanent unavailability, and other exceptions are respectively 503, 404, and 500.

Temporary availability marks the servlet as unavailable for a specified time, then resume from where the exception occurred : initialization or request.

Permanent unavailability marks the servlet as permanently unavailable, and further requests immediately trigger 404. Servlet is destroyed only if it had been completely initialized.

Other kind of exceptions just abort the operation : a servlet that failed to initialize will try to initialize again, and will continue serving requests as if nothing happened otherwise.

*Some practice*

This makes six case to illustrate.

. Unavailability during initialization
** 404
** destroy not called
** next requests trigger 404 immediately
. Temporary unavailability during initialization
** 503
** destroy not called
** next requests trigger 503 immediately or trigger initialization again after the timeout
. Other exceptions during initialization
** 500
** destroy not called
** next requests trigger initialization again
. Unavailability in doGet :
** 404
** destroy is called
** next requests trigger 404 immediately
. Temporary unavailability in doGet :
** 503
** destroy not called
** next requests trigger 503 immediately, or run as usual
. Other exceptions in doGet :
** 500
** next requests run as usual

=== Exceptions after some data has been sent ===

*Some theory*

Upon exceptions, the default response will only be sent if the client has not already received some data. If the client has already received some data, the response will be that specified by that data.

This is complicated by the fact that data sent to the response stream is buffered. If the buffer has been flushed at least once, either manually or because it was full, then the rest of the buffered data will be sent to the client, but otherwise, the buffer's content is discarded

Therefore, you should not rely on all exceptions triggering error status code when coding your servlets.

*Some practice*

Let’s illustrate this.

. Send some data, exception => error 500, no data

. Send some data, flush, exception => 200, some data

* Send some data, flush, send more data, exception => 200, some and more data, although the response was not flush

This  behavior does not simplify error handling in servlets.

=== Conclusion ===

In this video, we introduced the log function as a useful tool for investigating the servlet lifecycle and how exceptions are dealt with.

We discovered that servlets define their own logging API, have initialization and cleanup hooks, and handle three kinds of exceptions differently when they occur during initialization or during request handling.

We also illustrated the consequences of each exception in each of these phases.

In the next videos, we'll continue our exploration of the servlet API, with the goal of covering all the features thoroughly.

Your questions and comments will influence the direction of this exploration.

That’s all folks. Thanks for watching.
