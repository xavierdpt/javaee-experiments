
Java EE 8 setup : WAR + EAR Maven project in Eclipse Oxygen with Glassfish 5

In this video, we install the Java SDK, Eclipse, the Java EE SDK (Glassfish), and create a Maven project with a WAR module and an EAR module.

1. Install the JDK
https://www.google.fr/search?q=jdk&hl=en

Don't install the JRE, it is already within the JDK
If installed, it may update itself, resulting in two slightly different versions of the same thing.

2. Install Eclipse
https://www.google.fr/search?q=eclipse&hl=en
Possibly update the installer

3. Install Glassfish
https://www.google.fr/search?q=java+ee+sdk&hl=en

4. Install the Glassfish Tools in Eclipse Marketplace

5. Customize Eclipse Workspace
- layout
- encodings
- search/debug behavior
- browser

6. Create glassfish server in Eclipse

Check the JAR deployment checkbox. Not checking it may create some issues in some more advanced cases.

7. Create Maven POM project

groupId : example.company.myproject
artifactId : myproject-pom
version : 0.0.0

8. Set source and target java versions

Default versions are usually too old

9. Set source encoding

Default encoding is not UTF-8, which is almost always a bad thing because it is then platform-dependent.

10. Add javaee dependency

Better look for it

11. Create the WAR module

artifactId : myproject-war

12. Add javaee dependency in war module

13. Generate deployment descriptor

Eclipse has some hiccups here, it should be 4.0, but the best you can get is 3.1, although it usually starts with 2.5.

Update deployment to 4.0

14. Set display name to "myproject" and welcome file "index.html"

We keep things simple here

15. Create example.company.myproject.servlets.HelloWorldServlet mapped to /helloworld

Again, we keep things minimal here

16. Create index.html

A homepage is always useful

Add ./helloworld link

17. Create the EAR module

artifactId : myproject-ear

An EAR module is not always necessary, so you may skip this step.

18. Add maven-ear-plugin and myproject-war dependency

19. Deploy EAR to server

20. Check that it's working

It works !

That's all folks.

For this time.
